<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />
<small>THE RESULT OF A WHIPPING.</small></h2>


<p>Hoeing corn is not very hard work for
one who is accustomed to it, but the circumstances
of the hoeing may make the
task an exceedingly laborious one. They
did so in Joe Gaston’s case. Joe Gaston
thought he had never in his life before
been put to such hard and disagreeable
work.</p>

<p>In the first place, the ground had been
broken up only that spring, and it was
very rough and stony. Next, the field
was on a western slope, and the rays of
the afternoon sun shone squarely on it.
It was an unusually oppressive day, too,
for the last of June.</p>

<p>Finally, and chiefly: Joe was a fourteen-year-old
boy, fond of sport and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
companionship, and he was working there
alone.</p>

<p>Leaning heavily on the handle of his
hoe, Joe gazed pensively away to the west.
At the foot of the slope lay a small lake,
its unruffled surface reflecting with startling
distinctness the foliage that lined its
shores, and the two white clouds that hung
above in the blue sky.</p>

<p>Through a rift in the hills could be
seen, far away, the line of purple mountains
that lay beyond the west shore of
the Hudson River.</p>

<p>“It aint fair!” said Joe, talking aloud to
himself, as he sometimes did. “I don’t
have time to do anything but just work,
work, work. Right in the middle of summer,
too, when you can have the most
fun of any time in the year, if you only
had a chance to get it! There’s berrying
and bee-hunting and swimming and
fishing and&mdash;and lots of things.”</p>

<p>The look of pensiveness on Joe’s face
changed into one of longing.</p>

<p>“Fishing’s awful good now,” he continued;
“but I don’t get a chance to go,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
unless I go without asking, and even then
I dassent carry home the fish.”</p>

<p>After another minute of reflection he
turned his face toward the upland, where,
in the distance, the white porch and
gables of a farmhouse were visible through
an opening between two rows of orchard
trees.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll just run down to the pond
a few minutes, and see if there’s any
fish there. It aint more’n three o’clock;
Father’s gone up to Morgan’s with that
load of hay, and he won’t be home before
five o’clock. I can get back and hoe a lot
of corn by that time.”</p>

<p>He cast his eyes critically toward the
sun, hesitated for another minute, and
then, shouldering his hoe, started down
the hill toward the lake; but before he
had gone half-way to the water’s edge he
stopped and stood still, nervously chewing
a spear of June-grass, and glancing alternately
back at the cornfield and forward
to the tempting waters of the lake.</p>

<p>“I don’t care!” he said at last. “I
can’t help it if it aint right. If Father’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
only <em>let</em> me go a-fishing once in a while, I
wouldn’t want to sneak off. It’s his fault;
’cause I’ve got to fish, and that’s all there
is about it.”</p>

<p>In a swampy place near by he dug
some angle-worms for bait. Then, taking
a pole and line from the long grass behind
a log, he skirted the shore for a short
distance, climbed out on the body of a
fallen tree that lay partly in the water, and
flung off his line.</p>

<p>Joe had not long to wait. The lazy
motion of the brightly painted float on
the smooth surface of the lake gave place
to a sudden swinging movement. Then
the small end dipped till only the round
red top was visible. In the next instant
that too disappeared, and the pole curved
till the tip of it almost touched the water.</p>

<p>For a second only Joe played with his
victim. Then, with a quick, steady pull,
he drew the darting, curving, shining fish
from its home, and landed it among the
weeds on the shore.</p>

<p>Flushed with delight, he hastened to
cast his line again into the pool. Scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a minute later he pulled out another
fish. It seemed to be an excellent day
for the sport.</p>

<p>Indeed, he had never before known the
fish to bite so well. They kept him busy
baiting his hook and drawing them in.</p>

<p>He was in the high tide of enjoyment.
The cornfield was forgotten.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware that some
one was standing behind him among the
low bushes on the shore. He turned to
see who it was. There, confronting him,
a frown on his face, stood Joe’s father.</p>

<p>The pole in the boy’s hands dropped
till the tip of it splashed into the water;
his face turned red and then pale, and
there was a strange weakness in his knees.</p>

<p>He drew his line in slowly, wound it
about the pole, and stepped from the log
to the shore. As yet no word had been
said by either father or son, but Joe had
a vague sense that it was for him to speak
first.</p>

<p>“I thought,” he stammered, “that I’d
come down and see&mdash;and see if&mdash;if the
fish was biting to-day&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said his father, grimly, “are
they biting?”</p>

<p>“They’ve bit first-rate,” responded the
boy, quickly. “I’ve got fourteen in this
little puddle here.”</p>

<p>“Throw them back into the pond,”
commanded Mr. Gaston.</p>

<p>Joe bent over, and taking the fish one
by one from the little pool of water where
he had placed them, he tossed them
lightly into the lake. He came to one
that, badly wounded, was floating on its
side.</p>

<p>“’Taint any use throwing that one
back,” he said. “It’s&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Throw it back!” was the stern command.</p>

<p>Joe threw it back. When this task was
completed, Mr. Gaston said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Have you got your knife in your
pocket, Joseph?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Cut me a whip, then,&mdash;a beech one;
you’ll find a good one on that sapling.”</p>

<p>Joe took his knife and cut from the
sapling indicated a long, slender branch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
He trimmed it and gave it to his father.
He well knew the use to which it was to
be put; and although his spirit rebelled,
though he felt that he did not really
deserve the punishment, he obeyed without
a word.</p>

<p>“Joseph,” said his father, “do you remember
my warning you last week not to
go fishing again without my permission,
and my telling you that if you did, I
should whip you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose you expect me to keep
my word?”</p>

<p>Joe said nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Gaston stood for another moment
in anxious thought. He did not wish to
whip the boy, surely. Though he was outwardly
a cold man, he had all a father’s
affection for Joe; but would he not fail
of his duty if he did not punish him for
his disobedience?</p>

<p>“Joseph,” he said, “can you think of
any better remedy than whipping?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, if you’d just <em>let</em> me go fishing
once in a while,&mdash;say Saturday afternoons,&mdash;I’d
never think of running away
to go,&mdash;never.”</p>

<p>“That is, if I allow you to do what you
choose, you won’t be disobeying me when
you do it? Is that the idea?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, something like that.”</p>

<p>Joe felt that there was a difference, however,
but he could not at that moment explain
it. Besides, he wished to take the opportunity
to air other grievances, of which
heretofore he had never ventured to speak.</p>

<p>“I don’t have privileges like other boys,
anyway,” he continued. “Tom Brown
don’t have to work every day in the week,
and he can go to town every Saturday if
he wants to, and go to fairs, and have
pocket-money to spend; and I don’t have
anything, not even when I earn it. And
Mr. Dolliver lets his Jim take his horse
and go riding whenever he feels like it;
but I aint allowed to go anywhere, nor
do anything that other boys do!”</p>

<p>Joe paused, breathless and in much
excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gaston said, “It’s your duty to
obey your parents, no matter if they can’t
give you all the pleasures that some other
boys have. You are not yet old enough
to set up your judgment against ours.
We must govern you as we think best.”</p>

<p>Again there was a minute’s silence.
Then the father said, “Joseph, I had
intended to whip you; but it’s a hard and
unpleasant duty, and I’m inclined to try
you once more without it, if you’ll apologize
and make a new promise not to go
fishing again without my permission.”</p>

<p>“I’ll apologize,” replied Joe, “but I
won’t promise.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“’Cause you wouldn’t give me your
permission, and then I’d break the promise.
That’s the way it always goes.”</p>

<p>“Very well; you may take your choice,&mdash;either
the promise or the whipping. I
can’t argue with you about it.”</p>

<p>Joe was excited and angry. He did
not take time to think, but answered hotly
that his father could whip him if he
wished. Mr. Gaston tested the whip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
cutting the air with it once or twice.
It made a cruel sound.</p>

<p>“I want you to remember, after it is
over,” he said slowly, “that it was your
choice, and not my pleasure. Stand out
here, and turn your back to me.”</p>

<p>Joe’s chastisement followed. It was a
severe one. The pain was greater than
Joe had expected. The shock of the first
blow was still fresh when the second one
came, and this was followed up by half-a-dozen
more in rapid succession.</p>

<p>“Now,” said the father, when it was
over, throwing the whip aside, “you may
go back to the cornfield and go to work.”</p>

<p>Without a word, and indeed with mind
and heart too full for utterance, the boy
shouldered his hoe and started back up
the hill. Mr. Gaston, taking a path which
skirted the field, walked slowly toward
home. His mind too was filled with
conflicting emotions.</p>

<p>He felt that he was striving to do his
duty by the boy, to bring him up to
honest, sober manhood. Yet for the first
time he began to wonder whether the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
course he was pursuing with him was just
the right one to lead to that end.</p>

<p>He paused, and looked across the field
to where Joe, who had reached his old
place, was bending over a long row of
corn; and his heart filled with fatherly
sympathy for the lad in spite of his waywardness
and obstinacy. The father felt
that he would like to reason with Joe
again more gently, and started to cross the
field for that purpose. But fearing that
Joe might think that he had repented of
his severity, he turned back and made
his way, with a heavy heart, toward home.</p>

<p>As for Joe, his anger settled before
an hour had passed into a feeling of
strong and stubborn resentment. That
his punishment had been too severe and
humiliating he had no doubt. That he
had long been treated unfairly by his
father and had been governed with undue
strictness he fully believed.</p>

<p>Slowly, as he pondered over it, there
came into his mind a plan to put an
end to it all,&mdash;a plan which, without further
consideration, he resolved to adopt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
This, he was determined, should be the
last whipping he would receive at his
father’s hands.</p>

<p>He was interrupted in his brooding and
his plans by a young girl, who came down
toward him between the rows of springing
corn. It was his sister Jennie, who
was two years younger than he.</p>

<p>She looked up at him, as she advanced,
with mingled curiosity and sympathy in
her expressive eyes and face.</p>

<p>“Joe,” she said, in an awe-stricken voice,
“did Father whip you?”</p>

<p>“What makes you think he whipped
me?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Because, I&mdash;I heard him tell Mother
so.”</p>

<p>“What did Mother say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, she cried, and she said she was
sorry it had to be done. Did he whip
you hard, Joe?”</p>

<p>“Pretty hard, but it’s the last time.
He’ll never whip me again, Jennie.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to be a better boy?”</p>

<p>“No, a worse one.”</p>

<p>Jennie stood for a moment silent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
wondering at this paradoxical statement.
Then an idea flashed into her mind.</p>

<p>“Joe!” she cried, “you&mdash;you’re not
going to run away?”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I am going to do.
I’ve stood it here as long as I can.”</p>

<p>“O Joe! what’ll Father say?”</p>

<p>“It don’t make much difference what
he says. I’m goin’ to&mdash;say, Jennie!
don’t you go and tell now, ’fore I get
started. You wouldn’t do as mean a
thing as that, would you, Jen? Promise
now!”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I&mdash;maybe if Father knew you’d
made up your mind to go, he’d treat
you better.”</p>

<p>“No, he wouldn’t. Look here, Jen! if
you say anything about it I’ll&mdash;say now,
you won’t, will you?”</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no, not if you don’t want me to,
but I’m awful scared about it. What’ll
Mother say?” asked the girl, wiping from
her eyes the fast-falling tears.</p>

<p>“That’s where the trouble is, Jen,”
replied the boy, leaning on the handle of
his hoe, and gazing reflectively off to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
hills. “I hate to leave Mother, she’s
good to me; but Father and I can’t get
along together after what’s happened to-day,
that’s plain.”</p>

<p>“And won’t you ever come back again?”
asked Jennie, plaintively.</p>

<p>“Not for seven years,” answered Joe;
“then I’ll be twenty-one, an’ my own
boss, and I can go fishing whenever I
feel like it.”</p>

<p>“O Joe!” Jennie’s tears fell still faster.
“Joe! I’m afraid&mdash;what&mdash;made you&mdash;tell
me?”</p>

<p>“You asked me!”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t&mdash;didn’t want you to tell
me anything&mdash;anything so dreadful!”</p>

<p>From the direction of the house came
the sound of the supper-bell. Joe shouldered
his hoe again; Jennie rose from her
seat on a rock, and together they walked
slowly home. On the way Joe exacted
from Jennie a faithful promise that she
would tell nothing about his plan.</p>

<p>At the supper-table Joe was silent and
moody, and ate little. After doing the
portion of the chores that fell to his lot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
he went at once to his room. His back
still smarted and ached from the whipping;
his mind was still troubled, and
indignation and rebellion still ruled in
his breast.</p>

<p>Before he slept, his mother came to see
that he was safely in bed, and to tuck him
in for the night. She knew that this had
been a very bitter day for him, and although
she feared he had deserved his
punishment, she grieved for him, and suffered
with him from the bottom of her
heart.</p>

<p>It was with more than the customary
tenderness that she tucked the bed-clothing
around him, and kissed him good-night.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Mother!” he said, looking
up through the dim light of the room into
her face; “good-night!”</p>

<p>He did not let go of her hand; and
when he tried to say something more, he
broke down and burst into tears.</p>

<p>So she knelt down by the side of the
bed, and smoothing his hair back from his
forehead, talked gently to him for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
time. After more good-night kisses she
left him, and went back to her never-ending
work.</p>

<p>This, for Joe, was the hardest part of
leaving home; for he was very fond of
his mother, and knew that his going would
almost break her heart. Still, now that he
had resolved to go, he would not change
his mind, even for his mother’s sake.</p>

<p>It was long before Joe fell asleep, and
even then he was beset by unpleasant
dreams, so that his rest availed him but
little.</p>

<p>Before daybreak he arose, dressed himself,
gathered into a bundle a few articles
of clothing, a few of his choicest treasures,
and a little money that he had earned and
saved, and then on tiptoe left his room.</p>

<p>At the end of the hall a door was
opened, and a little white-robed figure
glided out and into his arms. It was
Jennie.</p>

<p>“O Joe!” she whispered, “are you
really going?”</p>

<p>“’Sh! Jen, don’t make any noise. Yes,
I’m going. There, don’t cry&mdash;good-by!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>He bent down and kissed her, but she
could not speak for the sobs that choked
her. After holding her arms around his
neck for a moment, she vanished into
her room.</p>

<p>Joe went softly down the stairs, and out
at the kitchen door. It was cool and
refreshing in the open air. In the east
the sky was beginning to put on the
gray of morning.</p>

<p>Jennie, looking down through the dusk
from the window of her room, saw Joe
walk down the path to the road gate, then
turn, as if some new thought had struck
him, and cross the yard to the barn, entering
it by the stable door.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed the child to herself,
in a frightened whisper, “oh! he’s going
to take the horse; he’s going to take
Charlie!”</p>

<p>She sank down on the floor, and covered
her face with her hands. She did
not want to see so dreadful a thing
happen. But curiosity finally got the
better of her fear, and she looked out
again just in time to see some one lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the gray horse from the stable, mount
him, and ride away into the dusk.</p>

<p>“O Joe!” she murmured. “O Charlie!
Oh, what will Father say now! Isn’t it
dreadful, dreadful!”</p>

<p>But though she did not know it, the
person whom Jennie saw riding away
into the dusk on old Charlie’s back was
not Joe.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />
<small>WHO TOOK OLD CHARLIE?</small></h2>


<p>Joe’s errand to the stable on the morning
when he went away was not what his
sister Jennie supposed. He went there
only to say farewell to the horse that had
been his friend and companion since he
was a little child. He loved “Old Charlie,”
and could not go away without caressing
him and saying good-by.</p>

<p>The great gray horse, wakened by the
opening of the stable door, rose clumsily
to his feet, and stared, a little frightened,
across his manger toward the visitor who
came so early.</p>

<p>“Hello, Charlie!” said Joe, softly, feeling
his way forward in the darkness of the
stable, and laying his hand on the horse’s
forehead. “I’m going away, Charlie; I
thought I’d come and say good-by to
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>He had talked to the horse in this way,
as to a human being, ever since he could
remember. To him there was nothing absurd
in it. Charlie, recognizing his young
master, pushed his nose forward and
rubbed it against Joe’s breast.</p>

<p>“I’m going away,” repeated the boy,
“an’ it isn’t likely we’ll ever see each other
again.”</p>

<p>He leaned over the manger, pulled the
horse’s head down to his breast, and laid
his cheek against it for a moment. Then
he went out at the stable door, shut and
latched it, hurried across the barnyard and
out upon the grassy expanse at the side of
the highway.</p>

<p>At the turn in the road Joe looked back.
He could see the white front of the old
homestead showing dimly against the dark
shadows where night lingered. It looked
so serene, so quiet, so comfortable!</p>

<p>He brushed away the tears that started
to his eyes, choked down the sob that rose
in his throat, and turning once more,
walked rapidly away toward the east. Almost
before Joe had turned into the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
from the bars, a man crept cautiously from
the shadows behind the barn, and advanced
to the stable door. He was short and
thickly built, and very bow-legged.</p>

<p>“Close call for me, that there was,” he
said to himself. “Another minute, an’
I’d ’a’ been inside o’ that there stable
door, an’ ’e’d ’a’ come plump onto me;
that’s w’at ’e’d ’a’ done. Queer thing,
anyway. W’y didn’t ’e take the ’oss, I
want to know, an’ not be scarin’ honest
folk out o’ their seving senses that way for
nothink?”</p>

<p>The man unlatched the stable door,
opened it noiselessly, and went in.</p>

<p>It was not many minutes before he
came out again, leading Old Charlie,
and stroking him in order to keep him
quiet.</p>

<p>The horse was bridled, and a blanket
was strapped over his back in lieu of a
saddle. The animal was evidently suspicious
and frightened, and moved about
nervously, snorting a little, and with ears
pricked up and eyes wide open. Once he
snorted so loudly that the bow-legged man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
glancing uneasily toward the farmhouse,
made haste to close the stable door and
lead the horse to the bars, where he could
more readily mount him.</p>

<p>“Nothing venture, nothing ’ave,” he said,
as he leaped clumsily to the beast’s back.
Then, having walked the horse for a few
rods, he struck Charlie with his hand, and
rode away rapidly in the direction which
Joe had taken.</p>

<p>Very soon, however, he turned the
horse’s head into a grassy cart-road leading
into the woods which he had carefully
explored the previous day. This he
followed&mdash;Old Charlie’s smooth-shod
feet leaving no track on the turf&mdash;until
it brought him out upon a little-travelled
highway about a mile distant.</p>

<p>Here the thief cut a sharp little stick
from a tree, and urging Old Charlie to a
rapid gait, galloped on ten miles or more,
until daylight had fully broken. Then he
took refuge once more in the woods, and
breakfasted out of a little bag of plunder
which he had brought from the Gaston
farm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“A good start, Callipers, me boy,” he said
to himself. “You mind your bloomin’ eye
an’ you’re all right. It don’t do to lose
your ’ead an’ go too fast, or go too fast an’
lose your ’ead.”</p>

<p>In the mean time, back at the farm the
cattle had begun to stir about in the barnyard
with the lifting of the night shadows.
It was broad daylight before the hired
man went up through the gate with two
gleaming tin pails in his hands. Smoke
rose from the chimney of the farmhouse
kitchen; the household was astir.</p>

<p>Every one was about but Joe. His
mother had not yet called him. She
thought to let him sleep a little later than
usual. Yesterday had been such a bitter
day for him!</p>

<p>“Where’s Joe?” asked Mr. Gaston,
coming into the kitchen. “Isn’t he up
yet?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the mother. “He wasn’t
feeling very well last night, and I thought
I wouldn’t call him till breakfast was all
ready.”</p>

<p>“Mother,” said the farmer, “I’m afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
you’re indulging the boy in lazy habits.
He oughtn’t to be left in bed later just
because he misbehaved yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, “he was really feeling
almost sick last night.”</p>

<p>Little Jennie, whose eyes were red from
weeping, and whose face was pale with
anxiety, listened timidly to the conversation,
and then stole softly from the
room.</p>

<p>What would happen when it was found
that Joe had gone? What would happen
when it was found that he had taken Old
Charlie? This was the burden of her
thought and fear.</p>

<p>Whatever it might be, she knew she had
not the courage to face it, so she crept
away to hide herself and to weep out her
grief.</p>

<p>“If Joe was sick last night,” the farmer
went on, “it was just because he was disobedient
and had to be whipped. I hope
he’s in a better frame of mind this morning.
It is very painful for me to punish
him. I wish I might&mdash;”</p>

<p>The outside door opened, and the hired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
man entered, interrupting Mr. Gaston’s
speech. He seemed to be troubled and
excited.</p>

<p>“Have you had Charlie out this morning,
Mr. Gaston?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Charlie? What Charlie?”</p>

<p>“Why, Charlie the horse. He isn’t in
the stable.”</p>

<p>“Not in the stable?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. An’ I can’t find him nowheres.
The bridle’s gone, too, an’ the
blanket an’ the surcingle.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” exclaimed Mrs. Gaston,
dropping the toast on the hearth in her
excitement.</p>

<p>“Who put him up last night?” asked
the farmer.</p>

<p>“I did,” replied the hired man.</p>

<p>“Did you tie him fast?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And shut the stable door?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but I asked Joe to water
him after he’d had his feed. Joe often
does that, you know.”</p>

<p>“Call Joe!” the farmer said sharply
to his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston hurried upstairs to the
door of Joe’s room.</p>

<p>She knocked, but there was no answer.
She called, but no one responded. Then
she opened the door and entered.</p>

<p>The bed was vacant. She looked into
the closet, behind the trunk, under the bed;
but no boy was to be found.</p>

<p>The truth suddenly forced itself into
Mrs. Gaston’s mind. Joe had gone&mdash;run
away!&mdash;left his home and her! She
grew suddenly weak, and sat down upon
the bed till her strength should return to
her.</p>

<p>Joe gone? She could hardly believe it.
How could her only boy leave her? How
could she live without him?</p>

<p>It occurred to her that he could not yet
have gone far, and that he might be found
and brought back before it was too late.
She hurried from the room, flew down
the stairs, and burst into the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Go after him!” she exclaimed. “Send
for him quick, before any harm comes
to him! He’s gone&mdash;he’s run away,
he’s&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who’s gone?” questioned Mr. Gaston,
dazed by his wife’s words and manner.
“What is the matter with everybody this
morning?”</p>

<p>“Joe! Joe’s gone! Follow him, Father,
do, and bring him back! Take Charlie
and follow him at once. He can’t be far!
Take Charlie and&mdash;Oh! Charlie’s gone,
too&mdash;they’ve gone, they’ve gone&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Together!” said Mr. Gaston, sinking
into a chair, and staring across the table
at his wife, who was already seated and
silent, dumb with the revelation of what
appeared to be both mystery and crime.</p>

<p>The hired man, after witnessing for a
moment the agony apparent on the faces
of both father and mother, opened the
door softly and went out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston was the first to recover her
voice.</p>

<p>“Father,” she said, “do you think Joe
took the horse?”</p>

<p>“It looks very much like it,” he said.
“They’re both gone.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but they may not have gone
together, after all. Or if they have gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
together, perhaps Joe had some errand that
we don’t know about, and will come back
soon. Maybe he hasn’t gone at all, but is
somewhere about the place now. Don’t
let’s accuse him before we know!”</p>

<p>“You are right; we’ll find the proof
first.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gaston went to the door and called
the hired man.</p>

<p>“Ralph,” he said, “don’t say anything
for the present about this. We think
some mistake has been made. But you
may just make a quiet search for the horse
around the farm and the neighborhood,
and let me know if you find any trace of
him.</p>

<p>“Now,” he continued, turning back into
the house, “we will search for evidence.
Let us go first to Joe’s room and see what
we can find there.”</p>

<p>Together the father and mother mounted
the stairs to the little east room, and
looked about.</p>

<p>On a stand in the corner Mrs. Gaston
discovered something that, in her former
hurried search, had escaped her notice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
It was a note in Joe’s handwriting, written
carefully in pencil, and it read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,&mdash;I am going away. Father
is too hard on me. I will come back to see you
when I am twenty-one if Father will let me.
Forgive me for making you feel bad, and for
being an ungrateful boy. Good-by,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Joe</span>.<br /></p></div>

<p>She read the note, handed it to her husband,
and, sinking into a chair, burst into
tears.</p>

<p>When Mr. Gaston had read it he went
to the open window and stood for many
minutes, looking away, thoughtfully and
sternly, to the distant hills.</p>

<p>“Father,” sobbed his wife, “you will go
after Joe, won’t you? You’ll find him, and
bring him back, won’t you?”</p>

<p>It seemed to her a long time before he
answered her.</p>

<p>“I believe,” he said at last, “that when
a boy runs away from a good home, it is
better, as a rule, to let him go, and find
out his mistake; he’s sure to find it out in
a very short time. If he is followed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
threatened and forced, he will come back
sullen and angry, and will make up his
mind to go again at the first chance.”</p>

<p>“But if he’s followed and reasoned with
and persuaded?” said the mother, appealingly.</p>

<p>“If he is followed and reasoned with and
persuaded,” answered the father, “he will
get a great notion of his own importance.
He will believe that he has gained his
point, and will come back impudent and
overbearing.”</p>

<p>“But think what harm may come to
him,&mdash;what suffering!”</p>

<p>“Probably he will suffer. There’s no
easy way to learn the lesson he must learn.
If I could save him from the suffering that
his folly is sure to bring on him, and at the
same time feel sure that he has really
repented and is bound to do better, I
would go to the end of the earth to find
him. But we’ll talk about that later.
There’s no doubt now that Joe’s gone.
Let us see if we can find out anything
about the horse. It will make a difference
if he has taken him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>But the good woman could not yet give
up her appeal in behalf of her boy.</p>

<p>“You won’t be too harsh with him, Father?
You won’t allow him to suffer
too much? If he don’t come back soon,
you’ll go and find him, won’t you,&mdash;if he
don’t come back by the end of next week?
He isn’t strong, you know, and he’s so
sensitive. And I can’t think he intended
to do anything wrong; I can’t think it! I
will not believe it!”</p>

<p>They were passing through the upper
hall to the head of the staircase. When
they came near to the dark closet that
opened on the landing, they were startled
by the strange noise that proceeded from
behind the door,&mdash;a noise as of some one
sobbing.</p>

<p>Mr. Gaston threw open the closet door
and peered into the darkness, while his
wife stood behind him, half-frightened,
looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Why!” he exclaimed, when his eyes
had adapted themselves to the inner gloom,
“it’s Jennie!”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” exclaimed Mrs. Gaston,
in another fright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jennie,” said Mr. Gaston, sternly, “come
right out. What does this mean?”</p>

<p>Poor Jennie, her eyes red with weeping
and with anguish written all over her tear-marked
face, rose from her seat on an old
chest, and came into the light of the hall.</p>

<p>She began to sob again as though her
heart would break.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” repeated her
father.</p>

<p>“N&mdash;nothing,” sobbed Jennie, “only
I&mdash;I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“See here!” exclaimed her father, “did
you know that Joe had gone away?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I was afraid he had.”</p>

<p>“Did you know he intended to go?”
asked her father, sternly.</p>

<p>“Why, he&mdash;he told me yesterday that
he&mdash;was&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Going to run away?”</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;yes.”</p>

<p>“O Jennie!” exclaimed her mother,
“why didn’t you tell us as soon as you
knew it, so that we might stop him?”</p>

<p>“He made&mdash;made me promise not to!
I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Little by little, in answer to repeated
questions, the narration broken by many
sobs, the child gave the story of the previous
day’s interview with Joe.</p>

<p>“Jennie,” said Mr. Gaston, finally, “have
you seen Joe this morning? Answer me
truly.”</p>

<p>“Ye&mdash;yes, Father.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Here, in the hall.”</p>

<p>“At what hour?”</p>

<p>“I don’t&mdash;don’t know. It was before
daylight. He was just starting. I bade
him good-by, and went back into my
room, and he went on downstairs.”</p>

<p>Jennie was lavish of her information this
time. The questions were getting dangerously
near a point she dreaded, and she
hoped there would be no more of them.</p>

<p>Alas! The very next question shook
the foundation of her guilty knowledge of
Joe’s apparent crime.</p>

<p>“Jennie,” asked her father, “did you see
Joe this morning after he left the house?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Father; I looked out o’ the window,
an’ saw him go down the path.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Which way did he go when he got to
the road?” asked her mother, eagerly.</p>

<p>“He&mdash;he went off that way,” replied
Jennie, faintly, “east.”</p>

<p>“He went east, Father!” exclaimed
Mrs. Gaston,&mdash;“east toward the mountains,
not west toward the river. It will
be easier to find him, you know. And he
didn’t take the horse; you see he didn’t
take Charlie!”</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Mr. Gaston, sternly. “Jennie,
tell us the whole story. Do you mean
to say that you saw Joe go down the path
and out at the gate, and walk away toward
the east?”</p>

<p>Half-unconsciously she made a final
attempt to save Joe.</p>

<p>“No, Father, he turned around and
came back up the path toward the house.”</p>

<p>The mother asked no more questions.
She instinctively felt that her worst fears
were about to be realized.</p>

<p>“Did he come back into the house?”
asked the father, mercilessly.</p>

<p>“N&mdash;no.”</p>

<p>“Where did he go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no way out of it. Jennie
must tell what she had seen.</p>

<p>“O Father!” she cried, “he came back&mdash;and
then&mdash;he went into the stable.”</p>

<p>“Did you see him come out?”</p>

<p>“No, oh, no! But I saw him ride out
through the bars on Old Charlie, and
away up the road. I did, I saw him. O
Joe! Oh, dear me! Oh, I wish&mdash;I wish&mdash;I
was dead!”</p>

<p>The little girl fell to wringing her hands
and sobbing again with great violence,
convinced that she had been the victim of
unhappy circumstances, and that she had
been a traitor to Joe, whom she loved
dearly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston, drawing the child to her,
sat on the stair-landing and said nothing;
but sorrow and sympathy, struggling for
the mastery in her heart, sent the bitter
tears afresh to her eyes.</p>

<p>Over the face of Joe’s father came a look
that had not been there before.</p>

<p>“I shall not follow him, Mother,” he
said. “He may have the horse, but he
must not come back here until he comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
in sackcloth and ashes. I am sorry that I
have lived to see the day when a son of
mine has come to be little better than a
common thief.”</p>

<p>The father had passed down the stairs
and out at the door, while mother and
daughter sat long together, mingling their
tears over the unhappy fate of the boy
whom both had idolized, and whose strange
folly had made him, to all intents and
purposes, an exile from his home.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />
<small>ON THE CANAL.</small></h2>


<p>It is at Rondout that the Delaware and
Hudson Canal, reaching across from the
anthracite-coal regions of Pennsylvania,
touches tide-water on the Hudson. It is
here that the bulky canal-boats, having
discharged their cargoes of coal, turn
their bows again to the westward. From
the low-lying lands at the river’s edge the
mouth of Rondout Creek curves back
into the hills, forming for miles a safe,
broad harbor.</p>

<p>On the northerly shore of the creek is
the wharf. On the left side of this wharf
long lines of canal-boats are tied to the
wharf posts, and fastened one to another.
On the right, canal stores, blacksmith’s
shops, and stables extend as far as the eye
can reach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early morning, before the activities
of the day have begun, this wharf is a
deserted and forbidding place, and on one
such early morning in September, with
chill air and cloudy skies, and not even a
rose tint in the dull east, there was no one
to be seen throughout the whole length of
the wharf save one slowly moving boy.</p>

<p>This boy was so dull and miserable in
appearance as to be hardly noticeable
against the general dulness around him.
His clothing was ragged and dusty, his
shoes were out at both heel and toe. The
battered hat, pulled well down over his
eyes, shaded a haggard and a hungry face.
His mother herself would scarcely have
recognized this scarecrow as Joe Gaston.</p>

<p>What his hardships and sufferings had
been since that June morning when he
angrily left his home, his appearance told
more eloquently than words can describe
them. Many and many a day he had
longed for the good and wholesome food
he knew was on his father’s table. Many
and many a night, as he lay under some
unwelcoming roof, or still oftener with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the open sky above him, he had dreamed
of that gentle mother who used always
to fold the soft covering over him, and
give him the good-night kiss.</p>

<p>But a few days before our meeting with
him here on the canal Joe had met, on
the public road, a roving wood-sawyer who
recognized him. They walked together a
long way.</p>

<p>The man, who had sawed wood for Joe’s
father several times, had been at the
homestead since Joe’s departure. He
seemed surprised not to find the horse
with Joe, and he finally asked the boy
what he had done with him.</p>

<p>He was still more surprised when he
learned that Joe had not had Old Charlie,
and knew nothing about the theft. But
poor Joe! It touched him to the quick to
learn, as he did, that at home he was regarded
as a horse-thief.</p>

<p>It was this that he brooded over now,
day and night. To think that they should
accuse him of stealing Old Charlie!</p>

<p>Joe had, in his wanderings, followed a
sort of circle, which had now brought him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
within a comparatively short distance of
home; but if, before this, he had thought
of returning there, the thought was now
driven from his mind. He felt that he
could not go back to face this charge
against him, for who would believe him?
It was time to turn his face to the westward.</p>

<p>Besides, he had said that he would not
return until he was twenty-one years old.
His pride had not yet been enough chastened
by misery to cause him to abandon
his foolish boast.</p>

<p>So here he was, on the wharf at Rondout
this raw September morning, seeking
not so much independence and fortune as
bread and shelter.</p>

<p>Joe walked slowly along close to the
buildings, for the wind that swept down
the creek was disagreeably cold. An
occasional raindrop struck his face. He
was very thinly clad, too, and he could
not help shivering now and then as he
pushed his hands deeper into his pockets
and turned his back for a moment to
the wind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped to look at a few loaves of
bread and a string of sausages that were
displayed in the window of a cheap store.
He wondered whether it would be wiser
to spend his last few pennies for his breakfast,
or save them for his dinner.</p>

<p>He had about decided to buy a piece
of bread, and was waiting for the store to
be opened for the day, when some one
accosted him from behind: “Say, you boy!”</p>

<p>Joe turned and looked at the speaker.
He was a rather stout, low-browed man,
with a very red nose and a shaven face,
upon which a rough stubble of beard had
begun to grow.</p>

<p>His pantaloons were supported from
below by the tops of his rubber boots,
and suspended from above by a single
brace, which ran diagonally across the
breast of his red flannel shirt.</p>

<p>“Do you want a job, young fellow?”
continued the man.</p>

<p>“What kind of a job?” asked Joe.</p>

<p>“Drivin’.”</p>

<p>“Drivin’ what?”</p>

<p>“Hosses on the canal. My boy got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
sick las’ night, an’ I’ve got to git another
one. Do ye know anything about
hosses?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Joe. “I’ve driven ’em a
good deal, and always taken care of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well, my boat’s unloaded, an’ I’m
ready to pull right out. Wha’ do ye
say? Go?”</p>

<p>“What wages do you pay?” asked the
boy, hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Well, you’re big an’ smart-lookin’ an’
know how to handle hosses, an’ I’ll give
you extra big pay.”</p>

<p>Joe’s spirits rose. True, the man looked
forbidding, and undesirable as a master;
but if he paid good wages, the rest might
be endured.</p>

<p>“Well, what will you pay?” persisted
the boy.</p>

<p>“I’ll give ye four dollars for the round
trip, an’ board an’ lodge ye.”</p>

<p>Joe’s spirits fell.</p>

<p>“How long does the trip take?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Two weeks.”</p>

<p>“An’ when do I get my money?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Half at Honesdale, an’ half when you
git back here.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know; I&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Make up your mind quick. If you
don’t want the job, I’ll be lookin’ for
another boy.”</p>

<p>Joe thought of his penniless condition.
It might not be long, indeed, before he
would be starving. Here was a chance
to obtain at least food and shelter, and
probably enough to buy an overcoat.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I’ll go.”</p>

<p>“All right. Have you had any breakfast?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Come along with me, an’ I’ll give
you some.”</p>

<p>Joe’s spirits rose again at the thought
of breakfast. He followed the man down
the dock a short distance, then from the
dock to a canal-boat lying close by, and
from this boat to another, and still another.</p>

<p>When the last boat was reached, they
went down into the cabin, where a colored
man was cooking food.</p>

<p>A leaf projecting from the wall was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
already propped to a horizontal position,
and on it were a few plates, knives and
forks, a dish of warmed-up potatoes, a
slice or two of fried ham, and some bread
and butter.</p>

<p>The negro was preparing coffee also.
The odor of it all was very pleasant to
Joe as he climbed down the steep cabin
stairs, and he did not wait long after being
told to help himself.</p>

<p>“I’ve hired this boy for the trip,” the
man explained to his cook. “What’s
your name, young feller, anyhow?” he
continued, turning to the boy.</p>

<p>“Joe.”</p>

<p>“What else?”</p>

<p>“That’s all,&mdash;for the present, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! Run away, did ye? Well,
I won’t be so partic’ler. My name’s Rosencamp,&mdash;Bill
Rosencamp. Cap’n Bill,
for short. An’ this gentleman’s name,”
turning to the negro, “is Blixey. He’s
like you; he’s only got one name; but he
can’t help it,&mdash;he never had no other.”</p>

<p>Blixey laughed immoderately at this,
and poured the coffee with an unsteady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
hand. He seemed to be so weak and
wavering in all his movements, his eyes
were so bloodshot, and his utterance so
thick, that Joe thought he must have
been drinking; but he had not been,&mdash;at
any rate, not that morning.</p>

<p>Joe enjoyed his breakfast greatly.
Though it was a coarse meal, it was the
best he had eaten for many days, and
when he was done with it he was ready
to go to work, and said so.</p>

<p>Accordingly he was sent to scrub the
deck, while Blixey washed the dishes,
and the captain looked after the tow. A
bustling little tug-boat had already made
fast to a fleet of empty canal-boats, Rosencamp’s
among the number, and was hauling
them up the stream.</p>

<p>Rondout was now awake. The island
in the bay was a scene of great activity.
The clang of heavy machinery and the
rasping noise of coal sliding on iron surfaces
filled the air. Boats were moving
in all directions. There were a hundred
people on the wharf, and twice a hundred,
many of them women and little children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
on the decks of the moored canal-boats.</p>

<p>Up the stream the scene became picturesque.
On each side were precipitous
hills, wooded to the river’s edge, their
green heights reflected in the still water
at their feet. There were cement mines
to be seen, and old white-faced mansions;
and half-way up the boat passed under a
lofty iron bridge across which dashed a
railway train.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the dulness of the sky
and the occasional falling of raindrops,
Joe enjoyed the ride very much. At
Eddyville the first lock, a tide-lock, bars
the way, and here the horses and mules
are kept.</p>

<p>“Do you see that stable over there?”
said the captain to Joe. “My hosses is
there. You go an’ git ’em. Ask for
Cap’n Bill’s hosses.”</p>

<p>Joe did as he was told. After some good-natured
chaffing on the part of the stable-keeper,
the raw-boned worn-out horses were
turned over to him, and the boy appeared
on the tow-path leading them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe was told that these animals were
named Jack and Jill. Jack had fallen
down the bank from the tow-path to the
river one day, and Jill had come tumbling
after. Whatever their names had been
before, this incident had definitely renamed
them.</p>

<p>The horses were fastened to the tow-line,
and the tow-line was attached to the
timber-head of the boat. Joe was duly
installed as driver.</p>

<p>His duties were not at all light. He
had to walk all the way, and to keep the
horses going at a good pace, which in
itself was no easy task. He must keep
on the inside of the tow-path, so that his
boat should pass over the tow-lines of the
loaded boats they met, and must pull up
sharply when a lock was reached.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the vicinity of locks,
great confusion arose from the crowding
of boats and the intertangling of tow-lines.
Then Joe became practically helpless.
But Captain Bill, after much pushing
and angry shouting, always managed to
straighten out matters and get the boat
under way again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>At Rosendale there was a long delay.
Something had gone wrong with the gates
at the lock.</p>

<p>Joe was not sorry for this, for it was
now late in the forenoon, and he was very
tired from his long tramp.</p>

<p>Captain Bill had gone off up the wharf to
a canal store, Blixey was busy in the cabin,
and the horses were drowsily munching
oats from baskets tied under their noses.</p>

<p>A drizzling rain was falling, and Joe
took shelter under a shed a little back
from the tow-path while he waited.</p>

<p>He had not been long there when a big,
uncouth-looking boy came shambling in
and sat down on a box near by.</p>

<p>“Hello!” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Hello!” responded Joe.</p>

<p>“Drivin’ for Bill Rosey?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Better look out for ’im.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“He’s <em>bad</em>.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ ugly.”</p>

<p>“Is he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, an’ works you to death. He’s
used up three boys a’ready; one went
home yisterday all stove to pieces. I
wouldn’t work for ’im; I quit.”</p>

<p>Joe was naturally very much startled,
but he soon found breath to ask,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Did you work for him once?”</p>

<p>“Did I? Well, I should say so.”</p>

<p>“What did he do to you?”</p>

<p>“Not much; licked me, an’ kicked me,
an’ robbed me,&mdash;that’s all. Say, what’s
he goin’ to pay you?”</p>

<p>“Four dollars for the round trip.”</p>

<p>“The thief!”</p>

<p>“Why, isn’t that enough?”</p>

<p>“Enough! W’y, five dollars was my
wages for the roun’ trip, an’ another feller
I knew was to have six; only we didn’t
neither of us git no money. Oh, he’s
a bad man, he is; you better look out
fer ’im.”</p>

<p>The boy rose awkwardly, as if to go.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Joe, anxiously, “I’ve
hired out to him now, you know. What
would you do about it if you was in my
place?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>The big boy sat down again more awkwardly,
if possible, than he had risen.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye jest what I would do,” he
began earnestly.</p>

<p>But he never told what it was, and Joe
never had the benefit of his advice; for
at that moment the bony figure of Captain
Bill appeared at the corner of the shed.</p>

<p>The jaw of the large boy dropped suddenly,
and jumping up from the box he
made his escape to the tow-path.</p>

<p>“You’d better git!” shouted the man
angrily after him. “What’d he say to
ye?” he demanded, turning to Joe.</p>

<p>“He said,” stammered Joe, “he said
that he used to work for you.”</p>

<p>“Did ’e say I used to lick ’im an’ kick
’im, an’ try to knock some sense into ’im?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes; something like that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I did, an’ I’ll do the same to
you ef ye don’t ’ten’ closer to business.
Come! Git out there to them horses!
See w’ere they’re a-goin’! Jest look at
that tow-line!”</p>

<p>The man’s look and manner were so
fierce that Joe dared not even reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>He hurried out to his disagreeable task
with a sinking heart, and began to draw
up the tow-line, which had slipped under
the boat, and which, after much scolding
on Captain Bill’s part, was straightened
out.</p>

<p>The boat was “locked through” at last,
and not long after Blixey called up that
dinner was ready. The captain ate first,
while Blixey minded the tiller. Then
Blixey ate, and afterward relieved Joe on
the tow-path.</p>

<p>There was not much left when the boy
reached the table,&mdash;not nearly enough to
satisfy his hunger. But Captain Bill
stood at the rudder-post looking fiercely
down the hatchway at him, and when he
had eaten what was on the table he dared
not ask for more.</p>

<p>“Wash them dishes!” ordered the
captain.</p>

<p>Joe washed the dishes, put them away
on the shelves, and then went up on deck.
The light rain of the morning had settled
into a steady downpour, and the boat was
drenched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Here!” said Captain Bill, “you come
here. Now take a-holt o’ this tiller, an’
push it as I tell ye to.”</p>

<p>Joe grasped the tiller, and the man
went back and began to pump water from
the hold.</p>

<p>“Pull it to ye!” shouted the captain,
as the boy, wondering how it worked, allowed
the tiller to swing slowly from him.</p>

<p>“Pull it to ye, I say! Can’t ye see
where the boat’s a-goin’?”</p>

<p>Joe pulled; but it was no easy matter
to check the impetus of the rudder in
the opposite direction, and the boat still
swung stern away.</p>

<p>“Pull!” shouted the man. “Don’t
stand there like a stick o’ wood. Pull!”</p>

<p>The boy was pulling with all his might,
but as yet without avail.</p>

<p>Captain Bill dropped the pump-rod and
sprang to the tiller. Seizing it on the
opposite side from where Joe stood, he
thrust it violently outward, pushing Joe
with it, backing him across the deck, backing
him relentlessly till the edge of the
boat was reached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy to save himself from the
water was obliged to turn and leap
toward shore.</p>

<p>Fortunately the boat was near the bank,
and Joe was able to scramble up the tow-path,
more frightened than either hurt
or wet.</p>

<p>Captain Bill shook his fist at him
angrily.</p>

<p>“You go ahead to them hosses,” he
shouted; “and you, Blixey,” raising his
voice still higher, “you come back here
an’ pump out this boat!”</p>

<p>Blixey, who had seen Joe’s mishap,
laughed hoarsely. His trembling knock-knees,
as he walked toward the boat,
seemed each moment likely to give
way.</p>

<p>Joe was very far from being in a laughing
mood. Never in his life had he been
treated like this. Still, violently angry
as he was, he feared to disobey this ruffian;
he was even afraid to remonstrate
with him.</p>

<p>He went forward meekly, took the gad
that Blixey handed to him, and resumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the monotonous task of urging on the
tired and miserable horses. He was already
drenched to the skin, sore in mind
and body, and sick at heart.</p>

<p>Once as he walked, he chanced to remember
how he and his sister Jennie
used to play on the haymow in the big
barn on rainy afternoons. Somehow the
memory brought tears to his eyes; but
he brushed them away and trudged
on.</p>

<p>Many loaded boats were met coming
down, and many locks were passed. It
was always a relief to the monotony to
come to a lock, and take the horses
around it, and wait while the boat was
being locked through. Often there were
little villages at the locks, too, and small
stores fronting on the tow-path, and people
looking out from behind the store
windows.</p>

<p>The rain came down as steadily as
ever. The tow-path grew muddier and
more slippery with every passing moment,
and the long hours wore on.</p>

<p>By and by it grew dark, but the boats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
in the canal kept moving. Lights shone
from the cabin windows, and red lamps
gleamed from the bows of the boats; but
the tow-path, where Joe walked, was
wrapped in the deepest gloom.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />
<small>CAPTAIN BILL BUYS A HORSE.</small></h2>


<p>It was a cold, rainy, and impenetrably
dark night on the tow-path. Here and
there was a lantern, which, when passed,
seemed only to deepen the darkness.</p>

<p>Now and then the swish of a tow-line
in the water was heard, or the harsh
scraping of a boat against another boat
or against the timbers of the wharf. Men
shouted hoarsely to one another or to
their beasts.</p>

<p>Along the muddy tow-path a pair of
drenched and miserable horses were urged
by a drenched and miserable boy. To
this boy, who was Joe Gaston, it was all
like some hideous dream.</p>

<p>He moved under a constant strain of
fear upon nerves already overwrought,
and with incessant physical effort on the
part of a body already worn to the verge
of exhaustion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>He found relief for a few moments
while he ate his supper. The boat was
waiting below a lock. The captain, who
had already eaten, went out on the tow-path,
and Joe’s only companion at the
table was Blixey.</p>

<p>When the two had eaten all that was
before them, Blixey said: “Well, young
un, had enough, eh?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Joe, “I haven’t. I’m
hungry yet.”</p>

<p>Blixey rose, and climbed far enough
up the cabin stairs to put his head out
and make sure that Captain Bill was
not on deck. Then he came back, and
opening a little cupboard under the dish
shelves, took out half a loaf of bread
and some cold ham, and set it before
the boy.</p>

<p>“Mum’s the word,” he whispered.
“Don’t say nothin’, but jes’ git around it’s
quick’s ye can.”</p>

<p>Joe followed the advice without further
delay.</p>

<p>“Blixey,” he said, between his mouthfuls,
“you’re very good.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>As he ate, the captain’s hoarse voice
was heard from the tow-path: “Blixey!”</p>

<p>“What is it, boss?” asked the negro,
stumbling up the cabin stairs.</p>

<p>“Send that young rascal out here!”</p>

<p>The negro crawled back part of the
way down the stairs. There was a certain
compassion in his voice as he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“You’ll hef to go, honey, an’ right
smart, too. I know him.”</p>

<p>So Joe went, and took up again in the
blackness of night his dreary, cruel task
on the tow-path. He thought it would
never end; that the sun would soon rise
at his back, and that he should be kept
right on at his work through another
day.</p>

<p>But when Port Jackson was reached,
at ten o’clock, the boat was tied up for
the night. The horses were put under
shelter in a stable near by, and fed. Then
the two men and the boy went down into
the cabin of the boat to go to bed.</p>

<p>Under the stern-deck there were two
bunks, and no more. These were occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
by the two men, so that Joe must
sleep on the cabin floor.</p>

<p>He was given an old quilt, and an overcoat
for a pillow. Removing part of his
wet clothing, he rolled himself in the quilt
and tried to sleep; but sleep would not
come to him. His physical and his nervous
system had undergone so great a
strain and fatigue that he could not at
once relapse into slumber.</p>

<p>The cabin was shut tight to keep out
the storm, but the water found its way in
nevertheless. Little rills ran across the
floor, and soaked the old quilt in which
Joe was wrapped. The air of the room,
which seemed little more than a box, became
foul and oppressive.</p>

<p>Visions of his own room at home floated
into Joe’s mind as he lay there. He saw
the spotless floor, the pictures on the
walls, the pretty curtains at the windows,
the warm, soft, tidy bed. He thought of
the dear mother at his side, soothing
him, with loving touch and gentle words,
to sweet sleep and pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>That he wept, then, tears of homesickness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of sorrow, of deep and bitter shame,
until he had sobbed himself to sleep, was
but evidence of the gentle and manly
spirit that lay beneath his boy’s foolish
pride and impetuous will.</p>

<p>The next morning Captain Bill awakened
Joe by pushing him rudely with his
foot.</p>

<p>“Come, get up here,” he shouted, “an’
go an’ feed them hosses!”</p>

<p>Joe rose. He was stiff and sore from
exposure and exertion. His damp clothing,
as he put it on, sent a chill through
his whole body.</p>

<p>He fed the horses, as he was told.
After the crew had breakfasted in the
cabin of the boat, the same monotonous
round of duty was taken up that had
occupied the day before.</p>

<p>Rain was still falling, and the cold had
increased. The water of the canal was
muddy, and the stream that ran along
below it was very high.</p>

<p>The tow-path was softer and more
slippery than it had been the previous
day, and walking upon it was more difficult.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
The boy who drove the weary and
wretched horses through the mud and
rain was far more tired and miserable
than they were.</p>

<p>Late in the forenoon the boat reached
Ellenville.</p>

<p>For more than a mile Captain Bill had
apparently been on the lookout for some
one. As they passed under the iron
bridge and in toward the lock without
meeting any one, the captain uttered a
sort of grunt of disappointment.</p>

<p>Just then, however, a man came down
the tow-path, leading a gray horse.</p>

<p>The man was short and stout, with legs
that were so bowed that it was a marvel
that they held him up at all. Captain
Bill’s face lighted up as he caught sight
of him. He leaped from the boat to
the tow-path, and went ahead to meet the
stranger.</p>

<p>“Well, Callipers,” he inquired, “got a
hoss for me?”</p>

<p>“You bet,” replied the man, “an’ a
powerful good un, too.”</p>

<p>Captain Bill went close to the bow-legged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
man, bent down to him, and said
something in an undertone. The man
listened and nodded.</p>

<p>Then followed a conversation which no
one could hear, except the persons engaged
in it. It ended with Captain Bill’s
counting out some money from a black
and greasy leather wallet, and handing
the money to Callipers.</p>

<p>Then one of the captain’s horses was
unfastened, and placed in possession of
the bow-legged man. The gray took its
harness, and its place at the tow-line.</p>

<p>All this time Joe had been busy at the
feed-box at the bow of the boat. At this
moment he came up and discovered what
was going on.</p>

<p>The gray horse first attracted his attention.
There was something about the
animal that reminded him strongly of Old
Charlie.</p>

<p>He looked again, and more closely.
The horse threw up his head and neighed.
It was Old Charlie!</p>

<p>Joe gave a leap to the side of the boat,
another to the tow-path, and in the next
instant he was at the horse’s head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Charlie!” he cried. “Charlie! Why,
Old Charlie, is this you?”</p>

<p>The beast whinnied, and putting his
nose down against Joe’s breast, began to
rub him in the old way.</p>

<p>Captain Bill and Callipers looked at
each other in open-eyed astonishment.</p>

<p>“Knows ’im!” exclaimed the bow-legged
man.</p>

<p>“Seems to,” replied the captain.</p>

<p>“Who is ’e?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know ’im. He’s a runaway.”</p>

<p>The bow-legged man advanced and
looked at the boy more closely.</p>

<p>“Bless my eyes an’ ears!” he exclaimed,
drawing hastily back.</p>

<p>He recognized Joe as the boy who had
visited the stable the morning on which
the horse was stolen.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Bill!” he said to the captain.
“I’m goin’!”</p>

<p>But at that moment Joe, running
quickly, intercepted him.</p>

<p>“<a href="#image01">Where’d you get that horse?</a>” he
demanded, panting with excitement.
“Where’d you get him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“I got ’im where ’e grew, sonny, but
they aint no more like ’im, so you needn’t
go lookin’ for one.”</p>

<p>“But I want to know&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You don’t want to know nothin’. You
go ten’ to them hosses,” interrupted Captain
Bill. “See where the boat’s gittin’
to. Mind your business and stop asking
questions.”</p>

<p>“But that horse&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind that hoss. You ten’ to
business. He’s my hoss now!”</p>

<p>“No, he’s not your horse! He’s my
father’s horse. He was stolen from my
father’s barn. He&mdash;”</p>

<p>The captain took one step toward the
boy, fastened his hand in Joe’s collar,
and dragged and pushed him to his
post.</p>

<p>Joe was frightened and cowed. His
lips turned white. He dared no longer
disobey.</p>

<p>He went ahead and resumed his monotonous
duties, but in his brain was a whirlpool
of rage.</p>

<p>The rain fell harder than ever; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
wind blew in fierce gusts; the tow-path
was muddy beyond description. It was a
day on which neither man nor beast should
have labored except under shelter.</p>

<p>Joe walked as much as possible at
Old Charlie’s head, urging him gently
at times, putting his arm caressingly over
the beast’s drooping neck, or twining his
hand in the long, wet mane.</p>

<p>He talked to the horse, too, in the old
familiar way; telling him of his troubles,
pitying him for his own hard lot, sympathizing
with him, until he fancied that
tears stood in the horse’s eyes. He knew
they were rolling down his own face.</p>

<p>It was evident that the horse had been
on a long journey, though the distance
was not great from the place from which
he had been stolen.</p>

<p>The thief was a crafty and skilful one,
and had kept the animal out of the channels
of travel, where search would be
most likely. What adventures he had
had, and what other operations he had
carried on meanwhile, no one knew.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, when both boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and horse should have been relieved from
further work, Old Charlie began to indulge
in a habit which he had acquired
on the farm.</p>

<p>Whenever he had thought his work
too hard, or his hours too long, or the
weather too inclement for further labor,
he would stop in his tracks and turn his
head around to his driver, and stand gazing
in mute appeal, until he was urged
forward.</p>

<p>Charlie had never been punished for
this. It was not really balkiness, for the
horse went on stoutly after a moment’s
rest. But for that matter, Old Charlie had
been indulged at home in all sorts of
queer ways.</p>

<p>Now, however, the case was quite different.
Joe tried to make these interruptions
as short as possible, so that they
should not interfere seriously with the
passage of the boat; but the horse’s
conduct soon attracted Captain Bill’s
attention.</p>

<p>“Tryin’ to loaf, eh? Well, I’ll cure
the lazy old beast o’ that,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>He took a whip from the cabin and
tossed it out to Joe.</p>

<p>“Next time that hoss does that,” he said,
“whip ’im! Don’t let him do it again.”</p>

<p>“No, sir! I&mdash;I’ll try not to.”</p>

<p>Even as Joe spoke Old Charlie stopped,
turned, and looked back at him with melancholy
eyes.</p>

<p>“Go on, Charlie!” entreated Joe;
“that’s a good fellow, go on!”</p>

<p>But Charlie stood still, half-turned in
his tracks, in mute remonstrance. It was
new business to him, and he had not a
favorable opinion regarding it. The
leading horse, nothing loath, had also
stopped.</p>

<p>“Whip ’im!” shouted Captain Bill from
the boat, which, with its impetus, was
bearing rapidly down on horse and boy.
“Thrash ’im!”</p>

<p>Joe lifted the whip and let it fall lightly
on the horse’s back.</p>

<p>“Get up, Charlie!” he cried; “get up
now, quick!”</p>

<p>“Oh, whip ’im!” cried the captain.
“Give ’im a good un!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the whip descended lightly on
Old Charlie’s back; but the horse did
not move. This, too, was new treatment,
which he did not seem in the least to
understand.</p>

<p>By this time Captain Bill was very
angry. He seized the tiller, and swept
it back till the stern of the boat touched
the bank. “Whip that hoss!” he cried,
leaping to the tow-path, “or I’ll whip
you!”</p>

<p>For an instant Joe stood irresolute;
then, with sudden determination, he passed
the handle of the whip to the angry man
who faced him.</p>

<p>“I won’t,” he said slowly, with set teeth;
“I won’t whip Old Charlie. I’ll die
first!”</p>

<p>Infuriated beyond measure, Captain Bill
seized the whip and raised it swiftly in
the air. Just as it was about to descend
on Joe’s head and shoulders, the frightened
horse, swinging his body around
nervously, caught the full force of the
blow.</p>

<p>But it mattered little to Captain Bill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
The beast was as much an object of his
wrath as was the boy.</p>

<p>Again the whip cut the air and curled
cruelly about the horse’s body. Again
and again it fell, while Old Charlie, frightened
and tortured, leaped and struggled
for release.</p>

<p>Poor Joe, who was trying alternately to
soothe the horse and to entreat the man
who was beating him, felt every stroke
of the cruel whip almost as sharply as if
it had been inflicted on his own back.</p>

<p>At last the captain stopped.</p>

<p>“It’ll be your turn next!” he said
savagely, throwing the whip toward Joe,
and leaping to the deck of his boat.</p>

<p>The tow-line was pulled taut, and the
boat moved on again. The poor beast,
still quivering with excitement and pain,
and allowing himself now to be led
quietly along, showed by the occasional
touch of his nose to the boy’s breast or
shoulder that he wanted his sympathy and
friendship.</p>

<p>So they trudged on together, boy and
horse, each helping and comforting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
other,&mdash;on in distress and despair, through
cold and rain and mud, into the darkness,
the dreariness, the frightfulness of another
night!</p>

<p>How they got through that evening
until ten o’clock, Joe could never quite
recollect. His memory recalled only a
confusion of lights and noises, of splashing
mud and roaring water, of tangled
tow-lines and interfering boats.</p>

<p>It was only when the horses had been
put up for the night, and he was once
more lying on the wet cabin-floor, listening
to the beating of the rain on the deck
above his head, that he was able to think
clearly. How everything that he had done,
and all his woes and troubles, rushed
before him!</p>

<p>With his prejudice and passion all
swept away, he went over in his mind the
events of the last three months. His
follies and sins became as plain to him as
if they had been committed by another.
Slowly but surely, as he pondered, there
came into his mind the irresistible conviction
that he must go home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The old and beautiful story of the
Prodigal Son came up from the depths
of memory and glowed before him. He
would go back, as did the child of the
parable; but he would go in such repentance
and humility as the Prodigal Son
had never dreamed of.</p>

<p>He could not wait. He resolved to
start at once,&mdash;now, in the night, in the
storm, if he could but escape his keepers.</p>

<p>But there was Charlie,&mdash;poor Old
Charlie!&mdash;who deserved, far more than
did he himself, to escape from the sufferings
of the present. How could he leave
the old horse?</p>

<p>A thought came into his mind so suddenly
that it brought him up on his elbow.
Charlie should help him to escape! He
would take the horse home where he
belonged. They would go back to the
old home together.</p>

<p>Joe lay back for a moment, almost
breathless with his scheme. Then, cautiously
laying his quilt aside, he rose,
put on his jacket, hat, and shoes, and
climbed softly up the steep cabin-stairs
to the deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The rain had ceased at last, and low
in the west a half-moon was struggling
through the mist of clouds.</p>

<p>For a moment Joe listened. No sound
came from the sleepers in the cabin.
Then he leaped lightly to the tow-path.
It was not far to the stable where the
horses and mules were kept, and he lost
no time in going there.</p>

<p>As he opened the door and peered into
the darkness of the stable, the heavy
breathing of the sleeping animals came
strangely on his ears.</p>

<p>In a near stall, a dim, white shape
struggled up and was still. It was Old
Charlie. He recognized his young master
with a subdued neigh, and tossed his head
impatiently.</p>

<p>The next moment Joe had untied him,
and led him out into the night.</p>

<p>“We’ve got a long ride before us,
Charlie,” he said, standing for a moment
at the stable door to transform the halter
strap into driving reins. “It’s a long
ride; but then, you know, we’re going&mdash;we’re
going home!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the horse tossed his head, as if
he understood. Joe, catching hold by the
mane, leaped to Charlie’s back, as he had
done many times in the dear old days.</p>

<p>He rode slowly down the little hill to
the tow-path, turned in the direction from
which they had come,&mdash;the direction in
which home lay,&mdash;and galloped away.</p>

<p>Away they went toward the east, with
lighter hearts and higher spirits than
either had known before for many a day.
To Joe it seemed that he was doing no
more than his duty in riding away with
Old Charlie. He was too inexperienced
to know that he had no right to seize the
horse in this way, even though the animal
was his father’s lawful property. He was
too much confused by his sufferings and
excitement, moreover, to have a nice sense
of propriety in such a matter.</p>

<p>As he passed the boat he had just left,
Joe noticed that there was a light in the
cabin window. He heard a noise there
as of something falling. To his ears came
distinctly the sound of angry words from
Captain Bill.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<small>HOMEWARD BOUND.</small></h2>


<p>The window of the telegraph office on
the canal at Ellenville faces the tow-path.
Although day was breaking and
the sky was cloudless, the telegraph operator
was still working by the light of an
oil lamp.</p>

<p>He was taking a message, which, when
it was reduced to writing, read as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Stop boy on gray horse going east. Horse
stolen from me. Coming at once to claim
property.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">William Rosencamp.</span><br /></p></div>

<p>The operator, with the telegram in his
hand, went out at the door and looked up
the canal. As he did so he saw bearing
down upon him a gray horse ridden by a
boy. It was Joe with Old Charlie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Both boy and horse were splashed with
mud, and bore evidence of having come
far and fast through the night.</p>

<p>The operator stepped quickly out upon
the tow-path, and threw up his hand, with
the telegram still fluttering in it.</p>

<p>“Stop!” he shouted. “Hold up, there!”</p>

<p>Joe reined in Old Charlie, and the
young man seized the improvised bridle.</p>

<p>“Where are you going with this horse?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Home,” replied Joe, promptly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this Bill Rosencamp’s horse?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said the boy, stoutly; “he
isn’t. He’s my father’s horse! He was
stolen, and I’m takin’ him back home.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t Captain Bill have him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he hadn’t any right to him,
and he abused him, too.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you take him without Captain
Bill’s knowledge?”</p>

<p>“Of course I did! I couldn’t have got
’im at all if I hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’d better get off and
let me take charge of the horse, and we’ll
investigate this matter a little. Come,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
he called, as Joe hesitated, “get down!
Get down, I say!”</p>

<p>The boy let himself wearily to the
ground.</p>

<p>Several men and boys who were standing
near the offices and on the tow-path
came crowding about.</p>

<p>“The superintendent is due here soon,”
said the operator. “He’s coming up
with the paymaster, and he’ll settle
it.”</p>

<p>On the canal the superintendent’s
authority was almost absolute. Local
authorities deferred to him in all matters
pertaining to the canal and its employes,
unless the law were formally invoked.</p>

<p>The crowd stood about impatiently.
The operator still held the horse, and
Joe stood near, looking confident and
very earnest. Presently a steam-launch
came puffing up the canal, gave two shrill
whistles, and was quickly made fast to
the dock.</p>

<p>A heavy, well-built man, with a closely
cropped beard and a kindly face, stepped
from the deck to the tow-path. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
followed by a man who carried a heavy
valise, and by one or two other men.</p>

<p>They were the canal superintendent
and the paymaster and their assistants.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter here, Matthew?”
asked the superintendent, approaching the
group.</p>

<p>“This boy is charged with stealing this
horse,” replied the operator. “Here’s
the message.”</p>

<p>The superintendent took the telegram
and read it.</p>

<p>“Is this Bill Rosencamp’s horse?” he
asked, turning to Joe.</p>

<p>“No, sir!” repeated Joe. “He isn’t.
He’s my father’s horse.”</p>

<p>“But he acknowledges having taken
him from Rosencamp,” the operator
explained.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the superintendent, “Rosencamp
is coming. When he gets here we
shall find out whose horse it is.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to stay here till he
comes,” said Joe.</p>

<p>“Probably not,” remarked the operator,
sarcastically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The superintendent, who seemed to
perceive that this was not an ordinary
case of horse-stealing, now looked more
closely at Joe, and noticed the boy’s haggard,
hungry look.</p>

<p>“He won’t hurt you,” he said. “Rosencamp’s
a rough fellow, but he won’t hurt
any one around here; and if it turns out
that the horse is yours or your father’s,
you will get possession of him, of course.
Meantime we shall have to find out the
exact truth of the matter. Have you had
any breakfast?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Joe, “I haven’t had
any, nor Old Charlie either.”</p>

<p>The superintendent smiled. “Matthew,”
he said, “tell the stable-man to take this
horse up to the barn and feed him and
rub him down. And you,” turning to
the boy, who was not a little bewildered
by the invitation, “come with me.”</p>

<p>He led the way across the street into a
large boarding-house. There, in a warm
and pleasant dining-room, Joe ate the
first good meal he had taken in several
weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Under its cheering influence his heart
warmed, his tongue was loosened, and to
Mrs. Jones, the kind landlady, who sat by
and served him, he told the story of his
folly, his suffering, and his desire.</p>

<p>When he had finished his breakfast,
Mrs. Jones went with him to the office,
and calling the superintendent aside,
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“This boy is no thief. He is honest
and right in what he has done.”</p>

<p>“We shall soon find out about it,” was
the reply. “Here comes Rosencamp.”</p>

<p>Captain Bill rode up to the office door,
dismounted, and tied his horse. To the
group of men and boys who quickly surrounded
him he told, with many threats
and much rough language, the story of
his night ride, and denounced the wickedness
of Joe.</p>

<p>“Ef I once git my hands on ’im,” he
muttered, “he’ll never want to see another
hoss agin as long as <em>he</em> lives!”</p>

<p>Tired with his journey, splashed with
mud, his face red with anger, he entered
the office and demanded the gray horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Was it your horse that the boy took?”
inquired the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Course it was,” replied Captain Bill,
with a fine pretence of indignation.</p>

<p>“Where did you get the horse?” was
the next question.</p>

<p>“Bought ’im.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Right here in Ellenville.”</p>

<p>“From whom?”</p>

<p>Rosencamp hesitated a little. “I don’t
rightly know the man’s name,” he said.
“A feller ’at had ’im to sell.”</p>

<p>“I know!” piped out a shrill voice from
the crowd that had gathered in the room.
“It was Callipers, the man that’s been
in prison for horse-stealing. I see ’em
strike the bargain here on the tow-path
yisterday.”</p>

<p>Rosencamp lost something of his
bravado. The kindly look disappeared
from the face of the superintendent.</p>

<p>“Did you get this horse from Callipers?”
he asked severely.</p>

<p>“Well, yes, if that’s what ’is name is,”
replied Captain Bill, doggedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you know that Callipers has
been convicted of horse-stealing?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know’s I do.”</p>

<p>“And didn’t you know that this horse
had been stolen?”</p>

<p>“If I had ’a’ knowed it, do you s’pose
I’d ’a’ took ’im? Who says it was a
stolen hoss, anyhow?” added Captain Bill,
looking the crowd over savagely.</p>

<p>“I say so,” said a man who had just
entered the room. “I saw Callipers arrested
last night for stealing the horse he
traded to Bill Rosencamp. The constable
has the irons on him now, and the sheriff
has gone across to Port Jervis to head off
the horse.”</p>

<p>“Well, Rosencamp,” said the superintendent,
“what have you to say to
that?”</p>

<p>“If the hoss was stole,” said Rosencamp,
“how was I to know it? Nobody
told me it was stolen.”</p>

<p>“Yes, somebody did tell you!” exclaimed
Joe. “I told you the horse was stolen,
and the man you got him of stood right
there an’ didn’t deny it, either! I said it
was my father’s horse, an’ it is!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The superintendent turned to Joe.
“Who is your father?” he asked.</p>

<p>Joe hesitated a moment. Then he
replied, “His name is Gaston.”</p>

<p>“What Gaston? Do you mean Leonard
Gaston, of Laymanville?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, that’s his name. That’s
where he lives.”</p>

<p>“And you&mdash;look here! Are you the
boy who ran away from home last June?
I know your father, if you are Joseph Gaston,
and I know that he has been breaking
his heart about you for three months.”</p>

<p>Joe turned his face from the crowd,
and looked down at the floor. There
was perfect stillness in the room. Joe
was the first to break the silence. He
held up his head, and looked the superintendent
squarely in the face.</p>

<p>“I did run away from home,” he said,
“and it was foolish and it was wicked. I
didn’t know it then, but I do now, and I
want to go back, especially since I found
the horse. I think maybe if I take Old
Charlie back with me they&mdash;they won’t
be so hard on me; they&mdash;they’ll be
gladder to&mdash;to&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy burst into tears, and broke
down completely. The superintendent
rose from his chair, and opened the door
into a private office.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said to Joe; “come in here.
I want to talk with you.”</p>

<p>On the threshold the superintendent
turned to look at Captain Bill.</p>

<p>“Are you going to institute proceedings
against this boy? If you are, he will be
placed under bonds, and I shall become
his bondsman. If you are not going to
prosecute him, you may go straight back
to your boat,” he said sharply. “And if
I hear of your dealing in stolen horses
again, or abusing any more boys, this
canal company will dispense with your
services on very short notice.”</p>

<p>Rosencamp, disappointed, cowed, more
angry than ever, knowing that he could
not prosecute Joe, made his way to the
door and out to the tow-path amid the
jeers of the waiting crowd. He mounted
his horse, and rode away.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later Joe and the superintendent
came out from the private office.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
It was evident that the boy had been
weeping; but in his eyes there was a look
of gladness and firmness that expressed,
more plainly than words could have done,
the condition of his mind.</p>

<p>“Matthew,” said the superintendent,
“tell the stable-man to get this boy’s
horse, put a saddle and bridle on him,
and bring him here. Have him get out
a horse for you, for I want you to go with
the boy as far as Darbytown. From
there he knows the way home, and can
go alone.”</p>

<p>That afternoon, while the sun was still
high, Joe and Old Charlie were on the
highway not far from their home. Matthew
had left them at Darbytown, after
getting a good dinner for all of them,
and now they were travelling homeward
alone.</p>

<p>The old horse jogged on, trotting or
walking as he liked, stopping at the roadside
now and then to nibble at a tempting
bunch of grass or a bit of fresh foliage,
or to plunge his nose into the cooling
waters of a wayside stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Even now, however, they were not making
very slow time on the whole; and
earlier in the day they had gone faster.
It had seemed to Joe that he could not
wait till the white front of the old farmhouse
should come into sight from the
top of Hickory Hill.</p>

<p>The eager anticipation of his return to
the dear old home had heightened his
spirits, and brightened his eyes.</p>

<p>But after Matthew left him he began to
think; and the more deeply he thought,
the slower became his progress. Many
suspicions and misgivings had come into
his mind.</p>

<p>He no longer paid heed to the beauty
of the day, the splendor of the sun, or the
rich luxuriance of the early autumn foliage.
He was looking only into his own
heart. He was thinking only of his inexcusable
folly and wickedness in leaving so
good a home. He was wondering what
his father would say to him; how his
mother would receive him; whether his
little sister would ever again care to play
with him as of old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>He was wondering, indeed, if his parents
would wish to have him come home at all,
disgraced as he was; if the door of his
father’s house would not be shut and
barred against him forever.</p>

<p>“Hello, ther! W’at’s the matter wi’
ye?”</p>

<p>The exclamation, coming so suddenly
and unexpectedly, so startled Joe that he
almost fell from his horse. He had been
so deeply engrossed in thought that he
had not seen any one approaching. He
looked down now and discovered a little
old man standing near the horse’s head.</p>

<p>The man was shrunken, knock-kneed,
eccentric in dress and manner, and leaned
heavily on his cane. Joe recognized him
at once as a neighborhood character,
whom every one knew by the name of
Uncle Billy.</p>

<p>“W’y, I thought ye was asleep,” said
the old man. “I was fearful ye’d tumble
off the hoss.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t asleep,” replied Joe. “I was
thinkin’.”</p>

<p>“A-thinkin’!” exclaimed Uncle Billy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
“w’at right’s a boy like you got to be
a-thinkin’, I’d like to know?” He advanced
a step and laid his hand on Old
Charlie’s neck. “Ben a good hoss in ’is
day,” he commented; “looks like the
hoss Leonard Gaston use to hev,&mdash;the one
’at was stole.”</p>

<p>“It is,” replied Joe; “it’s the same
horse.”</p>

<p>The old man started back so quickly
that he tripped and almost fell over his
cane.</p>

<p>“Who be you?” he exclaimed, shading
his eyes with his hand, and looking up
intently at Joe. “You aint Joe Gaston,
be ye?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am; I’m Joe Gaston,” responded
the boy, sadly.</p>

<p>Uncle Billy retreated still farther.
“Well, I’m dumflustered!” he exclaimed.
After a minute he added, “W’ere ye
goin’?”</p>

<p>“Home!” replied Joe.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head solemnly.
“Ye won’t git much of a welcome ther,”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why? Is my father set against me?”
asked Joe, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Set aginst ye? That’s puttin’ it too
mild. He’s cast ye off. He’s unherited
ye. He won’t speak of ye to nobody, an’
he won’t let nobody so much as mention
yer name in his presience. Now what ye
think o’ that?”</p>

<p>The old man seemed to take delight in
giving his unwelcome information. He
looked up at Joe with a quizzical smile
on his thin face, and waited for an
answer.</p>

<p>Joe did not reply to the question, but
after a minute he asked,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do&mdash;do you know whether my mother
feels the&mdash;the same way?”</p>

<p>“Of course she doos! First along she
purty near cried ’er eyes out over ye.
She went around makin’ out’t ye never
stole that hoss; said ye’d be back in a
day or two an’ clear it all up. But she’s
give ye up now. They don’t none on
’em ever expect to see ye agin; an’ w’at’s
more, I guess they don’t none on ’em
want to. What ye think o’ that? Hey?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the old man smiled grimly at
Joe, and again Joe left his question unanswered.
He was struggling now with a
great lump in his throat that was growing
larger and more uncontrollable each
moment.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;what does my little sister&mdash;what
does Jennie think?” he asked, choking
sadly over the question.</p>

<p>“Well there now!” was the reply; “that
gal&mdash;I didn’t think o’ her. She don’t
da’s’t talk about ye to hum, ye know, but
w’en she’s away she kind o’ finds opportetunities
to discuss the subjec’. ’Twa’n’t
but last week she says to me over to
Williams’s place, says she, ‘It’s awful
lonesome without Joe,’ she says. ‘I wisht
he’d come back an’ be a good boy,’ says
she. ‘Aint it sad about his goin’ away
so?’ she says. ‘Do you think he’ll come
back agin soon, Uncle Billy?’ says she.
An’ I says, ‘No, he won’t never come
back agin. He’s gone too fur,’ says I,
‘in more ways ’an one,’ says I. What ye
think o’ that? Hey?”</p>

<p>But this time Joe could not have answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the question if he had tried. The
lump in his throat seemed to have dissolved
into tears; they filled his eyes, and
ran freely down his face.</p>

<p>The old man saw that the boy was crying,
and for a moment seemed to repent his
hardness of heart.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for ye, sonny,” said Uncle
Billy, after an awkward pause; “but I tell
ye they aint no use o’ yer goin’ hum;
they don’t ixpect ye, an’ they don’t want
ye.”</p>

<p>Still Joe sat, weeping and speechless.</p>

<p>“Well,” the old man added, “I must be
joggin’ on. Somebody might come along
an’ see us two together, an’&mdash;well, I’ve
got a reppytation to lose, ye know.”</p>

<p>He burst into a shrill cackling laugh,
grasped his twisted cane more firmly, and
hobbled on around a bend in the road
and out of sight.</p>

<p>Old Charlie, unheeded by his young
master, started on.</p>

<p>The sun sank till the light it threw on
the green September foliage was mellow
and golden. From somewhere in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
distance came the ting-a-ling of a cow-bell,
as the herd wandered slowly home. The
sound and the memories it brought started
fresh tears into Joe’s eyes, and when the
mist they occasioned had cleared away he
found himself on the summit of Hickory
Hill.</p>

<p>Down in the valley, half-hidden by trees,
he saw the white front of his home. Behind
it rose the gray roofs of the barns;
before it stretched the yellow road; on
it fell the soft light of the dying day.</p>

<p>He had drawn the reins and sat looking
down on it, while Old Charlie, pricking up
his ears in glad recognition of the familiar
sight, pawed the ground impatiently.</p>

<p>“No,” Joe said, at last, “we won’t go on.
It’s no use. I’m sorry, but&mdash;it’s no
use.”</p>

<p>He turned the horse’s head, and Joe
and Charlie started back.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<small>OLD CHARLIE BRINGS BACK JOE.</small></h2>


<p>On the day Joe left home his mother
put his room in order for him as usual,
and placed on the table a little bouquet of
red and white geraniums and verbenas.
She could not believe that he would be
gone over night, and she knew that when
he came he would be tired, broken, repentant,
and grateful for the least mark
of tenderness.</p>

<p>She delayed supper beyond the hour,
in the hope that he might come. Even
after the others had forced themselves to
eat, she set aside enough for Joe.</p>

<p>She went many times to the east window
to look down the road for him, and
sent Jennie to the top of the hill to see if
she could discover in the distance a boy
riding toward her on a gray horse.</p>

<p>But Jennie, whose eyes had been full of
tears all day, came back at dusk to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that she had seen nothing. Then she
went weeping to bed.</p>

<p>The next day came, and many days
thereafter; but Joe’s room was still vacant,
and Old Charlie’s stall was still empty.</p>

<p>Farmer Gaston’s grief was less touching
than his wife’s perhaps, but it was really
as deep as hers. The habitual sternness
of his face was tempered with the lines
of sorrow.</p>

<p>He had made no effort to find the
horse. There was no doubt in his mind
that Joe had taken him; but he did not
care to bring the boy into deeper disgrace
by making public search.</p>

<p>Mr. Gaston sometimes wondered if he
had taken the right course with Joe. His
theory had been that the more strictly a
boy was held to his work and duty as a
boy, the more earnestly would he follow
both as a man.</p>

<p>But he began now to think that possibly
he had been too strict with Joe. Had he
not left too little room for independence
of thought and action? Had he tried to
smother those boyish instincts of freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and fair play that go, no less than other
qualities, to make up the man?</p>

<p>His grief was mingled thus with a
degree of remorse; but he still believed
that it would not be wise to go out in
search of Joe, offering terms of forgiveness.
The boy’s offence had been too great for
that. His own salvation depended on his
coming back voluntarily in repentance and
humiliation, with a full confession of his
fault.</p>

<p>The hot days of July went by, and the
hotter days of August. The summer
tasks went on as of old about the farm,
but the old place had never before been
so silent and lonely.</p>

<p>The lines on Mr. Gaston’s face grew
deeper. He went about with shoulders
bent, as if bearing some heavy burden.</p>

<p>Joe’s mother, pitifully silent and anxious-eyed,
not venturing to question the wisdom
or oppose the will of her husband, went
every day to place fresh flowers in Joe’s
room. Every night she sat and looked
up the long road to the east till darkness
came and swallowed it, hoping, waiting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and yearning for the sight of her returning
boy.</p>

<p>Meantime there had been, after a long
delay, a movement in the community to
look a little more deeply into the matter
of the disappearance of Joe and the horse.
Squire Bidwell, who happened to be at
once the local justice of the peace and a
good friend of Joe Gaston, found it hard
to believe that the boy who had been an
apt and receptive pupil in his Sunday
school had proved to be a common thief.</p>

<p>The squire, moreover, had been Farmer
Gaston’s friend from boyhood, and he saw
with great pain the havoc which Joe’s
disappearance, and his father’s belief in
his guilt, was making in the family. He
resolved to do what he could to probe
the matter to the bottom.</p>

<p>He called together three or four of his
most prudent townsmen, and set them at
work making inquiries and doing a sort
of detective work. Presently it was found
that a farmer in an adjoining town had,
on the evening of the day after Joe’s disappearance,
while driving a cow from pasture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
seen a rough-looking man ride a gray
horse out of a wood-lot, and had found
the place where the man and the horse
had apparently passed several hours, and
eaten a meal or two.</p>

<p>This clew was followed up. Still farther
on other traces of the real thief were
found. He had now passed quite beyond
any jurisdiction of Squire Bidwell, but
the authorities were notified of what had
been learned, and were on the alert.</p>

<p>Callipers was well known through previous
misdeeds. The man who had been
seen answered his description. For a long
time he evaded pursuit; but at last, as we
have seen, he was apprehended, the very
day after he had turned Old Charlie over
to Rosencamp on the canal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Late one September afternoon, after a
day of sunshine and blue skies, Joe’s father
sat on the westerly porch of the farmhouse,
looking away toward the lake, on
which the shadows were now falling deeply,
and thinking of what had occurred on
its shores on a memorable day in June.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>On the steps at his feet, her chin in her
hands, thinking also of poor Joe, sat his
daughter Jennie. Mrs. Gaston, busy with
some household task, moved about in the
rooms near by.</p>

<p>Suddenly through the lane around the
corner of the house came Squire Bidwell.
He declined Mrs. Gaston’s invitation to
enter the house, and Mr. Gaston’s invitation
to take a chair on the porch. Then
with some embarrassment, as though he
were treading on delicate ground, the
squire said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Neighbor, you remember that gray
horse you used to have?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mr. Gaston, coldly. “I
remember him.”</p>

<p>“Well, some of us were talking about
that horse the other day, and&mdash;and we
kind of thought we’d look him up. We
haven’t found him yet&mdash;”</p>

<p>“No, I presume not.”</p>

<p>“But we found out who took him.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we know who took him,”
said Mr. Gaston, uneasily.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you do, Gaston,” said the
squire. “It wasn’t Joe.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the farmer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston had approached, and called
out eagerly, “Mr. Bidwell!”</p>

<p>“O Joe! Oh, goody!” screamed Jennie.</p>

<p>“No,” repeated the squire, “it wasn’t
your boy. It was a common horse-thief,&mdash;a
bow-legged, stumpy fellow by the
nickname of Callipers.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure about this?” questioned
Mr. Gaston. “What evidence have you
got?”</p>

<p>“You won’t deceive us?” exclaimed Joe’s
mother.</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Gaston, I wouldn’t,” said
the squire, who had now found his tongue,&mdash;“not
for anything. What I’m telling
you is truth, every word of it. Joe didn’t
take that horse. He didn’t know any more
about the taking of that horse than you
did,&mdash;not a bit. But we’ve run down the
man who did it, from one clew to another,
and the deputy sheriff’s got him in a
wagon out here in the road in front of the
house now. Will you go out and see
him? I guess maybe he can tell you
something about Joe. He seems inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to make a clean breast of it. I’d have
brought him around here with me, but
the sheriff’s got handcuffs on him, and
it’s hard to get him out and in the
wagon.”</p>

<p>The next minute all four were on their
way to the front gate. Callipers sat there
in the wagon, under the eye of the deputy
sheriff, with stoical indifference on his
face.</p>

<p>“Good evenin’, ladies!” he said briskly,
as the party approached him. “Good evenin’,
Mr. Gaston, sir. I’m sorry to ’ave
put you to the trouble of comin’ out ’ere,
sir, but circumstances over which, as I
may say, I have no control has made it
inconwenient for me to meet you in your
’ouse.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” answered Mr. Gaston,
sharply. “I’ll talk to you here.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir! I’m glad to meet
you an’ your hinteresting family, sir. I
’ad the pleasure o’ visitin’ your ’andsome
place once before, sir. It was in lovely
June, in the early mornin’, sir. I may
say it was so early that I ’adn’t the ’eart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to disturb your slumbers. But as the
result o’ that ’ere visit, be’old me now!”</p>

<p>The man held up his hands to show the
steel bands firmly clasped about his wrists,
and joined by a few short links.</p>

<p>“Do you know anything about my
son?” asked Mr. Gaston, abruptly.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I will proceed with my tale.
You see I was jest about to enter the
stable door that mornin’ w’en that young
feller appeared a-comin’ down the path,
and as ’e appeared I disappeared be’ind
the corner o’ the barn. He went in w’ere
the ’oss was, an’ talked some sort o’ rubbish
to ’im about ’is goin’ away an’ all
that, you know. I couldn’t quite make
out the drift of it. But ’e bid good-by to
the ’oss, an’ went out a-wipin’ of ’is eyes,
an’ struck into the road ’ere, an’ walked
away in that direction.”</p>

<p>The man was about to indicate the
direction referred to; but finding his right
hand securely clasped to the other, he
abandoned the attempt, begging to be excused
from pointing out the direction.</p>

<p>“Seein’ that the ’oss was up an’ awake,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
he continued, “an’ probably wouldn’t
sleep no more that mornin’ anyhow, I
took ’im with me into the country.”</p>

<p>“But about Joe, the boy?” asked Mr.
Gaston, eagerly. “Have you seen him
since?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, sir, I ’ave. But now, look
’ere; you expects me to criminate myself,
do you?”</p>

<p>“It will probably go less hard with
you,” said Squire Bidwell, “if you tell the
whole story of your performances, and
reveal what you know about this boy that
you’ve put under such a grave suspicion.”</p>

<p>“All right, all right,” said the horse-thief.
“You’ve got me, ’ard and tight,
that’s sure, an’ I don’t see no way out o’
it, now. I can give Mr. Gaston information
that will lead him to the boy and
the ’oss, sir.”</p>

<p>Then the man told how he had seen Joe
on the canal, driving the tow-horses.</p>

<p>“How do you know it was our son you
saw?” inquired Mr. Gaston, sternly.</p>

<p>“Well, it was the same lad that went
into the barn an’ came out of it again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
that lovely mornin’ in June. Besides, this
’ere gray ’oss was there, you know, and
the ’oss knowed ’im, an’ ’e knowed the
’oss. W’y, w’en they see each other on
the canal, they was that tickled they
rubbed noses an’ cried,&mdash;both of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Papa,” exclaimed Jennie, “that was
Joe! I know it was! It was Joe and
Old Charlie!”</p>

<p>“To tell the truth,” said Callipers, “the
lad didn’t look just to say swell. ’Is
clothes, if I must remark on ’em, seemed
to be summat the worse for wear. His
jacket an’ trousers was jest about so-so.
’Is shoes ’ad give out in places too
numerous to mention. An’ there was
’ardly enough left of the ’at ’e ’ad on to
make it proper to speak of it.”</p>

<p>“Father,” exclaimed Mrs. Gaston,
“we must get him at once. He is in
want; he is suffering! He is honest,
too. He has been foolish and headstrong,
but he is honest, and we have wronged
him in our thought every day for three
months. Now he must come home!”</p>

<p>It had been many years since Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Gaston had expressed herself in so positive
a manner as this to her husband.
But now it was not necessary. He was
as impatient for Joe’s return as she.</p>

<p>“I shall go to-morrow morning,” he
said firmly, “and find him and bring him
home.”</p>

<p>For the last two or three minutes Squire
Bidwell had been gazing intently at something
that had attracted his notice off on
the hillside in the distance.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” he exclaimed, finally,
“that <em>is</em> curious. Look!”</p>

<p>He pointed to the place where the open
country road wound up the long slope of
Hickory Hill. The sun had so far descended
that the valley was in shadow,
but it was still flooding the hilltops with
its yellow light; and in its glow the figure
of a boy on a horse, almost a mile away,
was distinctly outlined.</p>

<p>“Do you see them,” asked the squire,&mdash;“up
there in the road? They’ve done
it twice or three times already. Now
they’re going to do it again; watch
’em!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>What “they” had done was this: The
boy was apparently laboring under some
indecision, as if wishing to remain on the
top of the hill. The horse, however, was
plainly bent upon rushing down the hill
toward the house. After a plunge down
the road, the rider would succeed in turning
the animal’s head up again; but he
would no sooner have got a fair start in
that direction, than the horse, swinging
suddenly around, would begin to gallop
furiously down the road once more toward
the Gaston farm.</p>

<p>Now, again, in sight of them all, the
boy succeeded in stopping the horse, in
turning his head, and forcing him to reascend
the hill; and once more the horse
whirled about and plunged down the road
toward the house.</p>

<p>This time, however, he received no
check. The boy, as if in weariness and
despair, allowed the reins to droop. The
animal sped on, and the next moment
both were hidden behind the trees at the
bend of the road.</p>

<p>Mr. Gaston, shading his eyes with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
hand, still stood gazing intently at the
place where horse and rider had disappeared.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaston’s white face and eager
eyes, fixed on the point where the road
came out of the grove, showed that she
divined the truth.</p>

<p>“It is Joe!” she said, with forced
calmness. “He is coming home!”</p>

<p>Then Old Charlie, with his young master
on his back, bounded into sight, and
presently boy and horse were in the midst
of the group.</p>

<p>The next moment Joe was kneeling in
the road, with his father’s hand clasped
in both his.</p>

<p>“Father!” he said, “will you please
forgive me and let me come home?”</p>

<p>Before the father could reply, the arms
of Joe’s mother were around him, and
Jennie was laughing and crying and
clinging to his neck.</p>

<p>Then the good old horse, pushing his
nose in among the four faces that he
loved, met with a welcome that was no
less sincere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“He made me come,” explained Joe,
a minute later. “I got to the top of the
hill, and my courage gave out, and I
didn’t dare come down, and I thought I
would ride back on the road a piece farther,
and then turn the horse loose and
let him come home, while I went on afoot;
but Old Charlie would come, whether or
no, and&mdash;”</p>

<p>Joe’s voice gave out. Every one cried
a little. Even Squire Bidwell and the
deputy sheriff and Callipers had tears in
their eyes. Mr. Gaston’s face, even with
the tear-marks on it, was radiant.</p>

<p>Soon the squire and the deputy sheriff,
with their prisoner, Callipers, drove off
toward the county seat. Then the whole
Gaston family went with Old Charlie to
the stable, and gave him his supper and
his bed before seeking their own.</p>

<p>Joe’s father and mother and sister were
happy people that night.</p>
